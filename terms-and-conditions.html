                    <div class="tac-addon-content">Existing Dway Remit users can earn a referral credit of 10 GBP (or equivalent*) towards a qualifying transaction if a friend and new Dway Remit user clicks on the unique referral link, or enters the unique referral code upon registration, and completes a qualifying transaction on the Dway Remit platform. There's no limit to the number of referrals that each user can send or the number of referral credits they can earn, but only one referral code can be used per qualifying transaction. Referral codes can't be used in combination with any other promotion code. It is also not possible to use promocodes/referral credits when sending money via a phone number.</div>


                    <h4 class="title-border custom mb20 mt30">What is a qualifying transaction?</h4>
                    <div class="tac-addon-content">A qualifying transaction must have a total sending value* of at least 100 GBP (or equivalent**), be to another country and in the case of the user receiving the referral, it must be their first transaction. If the first transaction of the user is less than the qualifying amount, the referral code can be used in a subsequent transaction with the same or higher total sending value as the qualifying amount. There is no expiry date on the referral code.</div>


                    <h4 class="title-border custom mb20 mt30">How to share referral codes</h4>
                    <div class="tac-addon-content">Referral codes should only be shared with people the user knows personally and should be shared on a platform where there's a reasonable basis that the people are personal friends. Dway Remit reserves the right to deny the referral amounts if there's suspicion of manipulation of the referral scheme, such as creating duplicate accounts with different contact details, sharing in unsolicited ways (spam) and anything else that Dway Remit deems to be not in good faith, abusive and a breach of this agreement.</div>


                    <h4 class="title-border custom mb20 mt30">How to request money</h4>
                    <div class="tac-addon-content">
                        <p>0. If you are requesting money, you only need to enter the amount and hit &ldquo;request&rdquo; in the mobile app.</p>
                        <p>1. You can only request money from contacts who have a phone number in one of the sending countries or if they are already Dway Remit senders. The sender will receive an SMS with the details of the request and have the option to download the app, sign up, verify the phone number and complete the transaction or just open the Dway Remit app and complete the transaction. As soon as the transaction is paid for and completed, you (as the requester) will be notified via SMS that the money has been sent.</p>
                        <p>2. You can only send a request to an unregistered number once, until that number is verified. When you sign up, we send a 4-digit verification code, via SMS, to the mobile number that you provided. Once you successfully enter the code, the number is verified.</p>
                        <p>3. You can cancel a request as long as the transaction has not already been paid for&ndash; paid by debit/credit card and have received confirmation in the mobile app that it was successfully done so.</p>
